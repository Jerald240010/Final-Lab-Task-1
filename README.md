# Final Lab Task 1 - MySQL Basics
In this task, we utilized MySQL to design and implement a functional database. We created multiple tables representing a sample company and established appropriate relationships between them. Additionally, we learned how to write and execute the necessary SQL queries to manage and retrieve data effectively.
## Step 1:
Create a table named employees with the following fields:
A field called employee_id, which is a unique integer, automatically increases, and is the primary key.

A field called employee_name, which is a string (VARCHAR) that can have up to 255 characters and cannot be null.

A field called manager_id, which is an integer and a foreign key that references the employee_id in the same table (employees).

## Step 2:
Create a table named departments with the following fields:
A field called department_id, which is a unique integer, automatically increases, and is the primary key.

A field called department_name, which is a string (VARCHAR) with up to 255 characters and cannot be null.
## Step 3:
Create a table named employee_departments with the following fields:
A field called employee_id, which is an integer and a foreign key referencing employee_id in the employees table.

A field called department_id, which is an integer and a foreign key referencing department_id in the departments table.

A composite primary key made up of both employee_id and department_id.
## Step 4:
Create a table named employee_projects with the following fields:
A field called employee_id, which is an integer and a foreign key referencing employee_id in the employees table.

A field called project_name, which is a string (VARCHAR) with up to 255 characters and cannot be null.
## Step 5:
Create a table named managers with the following fields:
A field called manager_id, which is a unique integer, automatically increases, and is the primary key.

A field called employee_id, which is an integer and a foreign key referencing employee_id in the employees table.
